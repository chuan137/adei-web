### Some features
* It is possible to register recurrent tasks (via cron) to run at scheduled times and/or after the completion of certain actions. In this way it is possible to run long and compute-intensive tasks in the background without slowing down navigation.
* The administrative interface, admin, is only accessible from localhost unless you run web2py behind Apache with mod_proxy.
